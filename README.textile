h1. Introduction

Pilot is a graph database operator that allows you to perform common application-level operations on graph databases without delving into the details of their implementation or requiring knowledge of the component technologies. 
Pilot aims to support graph databases conforming to the "property graph model":http://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph. Pilot employs technologies from the "Tinkerpop":http://www.tinkerpop.com stack -- specifically "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com and "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com -- for general access and manipulation of the underlying graph database, but also uses native graph database APIs to further optimize performance for certain operations. In addition, Pilot also handles multithreading and transaction management, while keeping all of these abstracted away from the calling application.

* Supported graph database providers:
** "OrientDB":http://www.orientechnologies.com
** "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org
** (others may be added in future if there is demand)

* Some of the functionality currently supported by Pilot include:
** Get edges between given vertices
** Get neighbors of a given vertex
** Retrieving vertices corresponding to some properties (see Property Graph Model)
** Transaction management
** Thread synchronization for multithreaded access
** Large commit optimization (alpha)

* Planned additions:
** FOAF
** DFS
** BFS
** Usage profiling

h1. Using Pilot

To use Pilot in your project, simply drop the JAR into your project or system classpath.

h1. Examples

h3. Initializing a graph

GraphInterface myGraph = GraphManagerProxy.newInstance('/Users/sid/graph/mygraphdb1', GraphInterface.GraphProvider.ORIENTDB, true) //the read-only flag will be removed in a future version

h3. Miscellaneous operations

After initializing the graph, all operations defined in GraphInterface.groovy can be used by calling the methods on this GraphInterface instance (API is similar to the Blueprints Graph interface API):
Vertex v1 = myGraph.addVertex()
myGraph.setElementProperty(v1, 'name', 'Sid')
Vertex v2 = myGraph.addVertex()
myGraph.setElementProperty(v2, 'name', 'Dan')
Edge ee1 = myGraph.addEdge(v1, v2, 'friends')
myGraph.setElementProperty(ee1, 'since', 2007)

// retrieves the edge between v1 and v2
Edge ee2 = myGraph.getEdge(v1, v2, 'friends')

// get list of friends by name
myGraph.getNeighbors(v1, 'friends', 'name')

h3. Transactions

myGraph.beginManagedTransaction()

//...
// as many graph operations/mutations as you like
//...

myGraph.concludeManagedTransaction()

h1. Documentation

More documentation is on the way! For now, looking at GraphInterface.groovy would be a way to get familiar with the API.
